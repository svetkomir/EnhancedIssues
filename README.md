# Enhanced Issues
This is a repository used to track Enhanced: Vengeance issues.

Add issues for missing features, broken things, crashes etc. Attach screenshots, save game files, logs and provide as complete description and steps to reproduce as possible. Thank you! 

## Steps to reproduce

These are super helpful. If you can confirm the steps to reproduce the problem and list them, along with the other information, I will be very grateful.

## Logs
Location of logs: `<install directory>\Enhanced\Saved\Logs`

## Save game files
Location of saved games: `<install directory>\Enhanced\Saved\SaveGames`

`SaveGameMetadata.json` contains information about which slot corresponds to which save game name in-game. The SlotX.sav is the actual file that you need to attach. 

Alternatively just zip all the files in that folder and attach them and specify the save name in the issue - I'll sort them out.
